# Loan-Prediction

Abstract:

In the domain of financial lending, accurately predicting loan repayment is a critical 
task for financial institutions. This project aims to develop predictive models for 
loan repayment using six distinct techniques: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple 
Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest 
Neighbours (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). These models leverage 
various borrower characteristics, historical data, and financial features to make 
informed predictions.

Key Components:

Data Collection: 
Comprehensive data related to past loan transactions, 
borrower information, credit scores, and financial statements are collected from 
reliable sources, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset.

Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, 
involving cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data into a format 
suitable for model training. Features like credit scores, income, employment history, 
and debt-to-income ratios are prepared for analysis.

Feature Engineering: 
Relevant features are selected and engineered to 
create meaningful inputs for the predictive models. This includes creating new 
variables, handling categorical data, and considering historical repayment patterns.

Model Selection:

a. Simple Linear Regression: A baseline model is established to understand 
the linear relationship between individual features and the likelihood of loan 
repayment.

b. Multiple Linear Regression: This model extends simple linear regression to 
account for multiple independent variables, providing a more comprehensive view 
of the factors influencing loan repayment.

c. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is employed to handle complex 
relationships and non-linear patterns in the data, offering robust predictive 
capabilities.

d. Random Forest: A Random Forest ensemble model is built to capture 
intricate patterns and interactions among various features, enhancing predictive 
accuracy.

e. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN): KNN leverages instance-based learning to 
predict loan repayment based on the similarity of borrowers' characteristics.

f. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): ANNs are used for complex modeling, 
learning non-linear relationships, and adapting to high-dimensional data, 
contributing to improved prediction capabilities
